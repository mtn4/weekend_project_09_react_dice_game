            The game has 2 players, playing in rounds. <br />
            In each turn, a player rolls 2 dices as many times as he wishes, at
            least once. <br />
            Each result will get added to his temporary score, but if the player
            rolls a double six all his temporary score gets lost, and the turn
            goes to the next player. <br />
            The player can choose to ‚ÄòHold‚Äô, which means that his temporary
            score gets added to his global score. After that, its the next
            players turn. <br />
            Winner of the game: <br />
            ‚óè The first player to reach 100 points. <br />‚óè The opposing player
            passed 100 points in his total score.
